**Tell us a bit about something you'd like to learn more about in your field.**

I'm really excited about Rust and the future of safe software. Eliminating whole classes of errors through language features is a beautiful promise. We'll see where it actually ends up. I'd love to spend time using Rust to make some tools in the next couple years.

**Tell us about a newer (<3 years) technology you like and why.**

While I was initially skeptical, modern, at home VR gaming has absolutely blown me away. It's a tad older than three years, but I didn't give it a serious look until recently and I am floored by how good it has gotten. The gear is still a bit bulky, but the whole experience is absolutely outrageously good for how new it is. I'm excited for a company like Apple to get involved with their general sense of polish.

Dear Basecamp,

Thank you for considering me! I know you get a lot of applications and it means a lot that your team has committed to actually reading them. I am very impressed with the position Basecamp takes against some of the brutal norms of the silicon valley tech scene and I'd be very proud to work with you all.

And now if you'll indulge me, a short story.

I grew up building computers, installing as many different operating systems and distributions as I could find, installing and configuring interesting software, networking them together, and generally trying to make them do new interesting things.

I love computers.

It was a natural next step for me to learn to code, so I got a computer science degree and for the most part really enjoyed it.

I also love programming.

Due to a recent COVID related layoff I've been applying for software engineering jobs that I realized I just wasn't excited about. They were lovely people, but very specialized roles. I decided to put the job search on pause to really think about what I wanted to do, and where I wanted to do it.

I realized I don't feel compelled to specialize in a single stack or language. I love having a very broad set of skills. I thrive on a new challenge. I love automating processes. Learning how to use new tools, and writing my own. Applying my love for programming to my love for computers. And then I had another realization.

I love administering systems!

I'm really excited to return to my roots. I've got tons of experience with software systems; writing and maintaining them. I've put them in production and I've always been deeply motivated by having things running smoothly and correctly. Whatever team I'm on I tend to find myself being the person that's helping automate the development setup or trying to speed up deployments. I've always loved helping people install and configure tools to make their process better. At the end of the day I just seem to care more intrinsically about infrastructure being correct then I do about making new features. I feel like I have a calling to defend innocent people from the deep and often unnecessary complexity that software forces onto their lives.

It feels like kismet that after coming to this realization that I got an email that Basecamp is hiring system administrators. :)

Thank you again for considering me! Thank you for doing your best to make the hiring process robust and fair. Thank you for being an example of doing excellent work while maintaining a strong grasp on your values and doing what is right. Tech needs that now more than ever.

Cheers,

Chris Schepman
