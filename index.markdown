Hi! My name is Chris Schepman. I enjoy automation and making boring technology do useful things. I also love to teach. I work best with people that are kind and smart. I believe that empathy not only makes for a better work experience, but leads to better systems as well.

My [writing](/archive) is the main thing you will find on this site.

My relevant experience includes working with companies like:

* [Apple](http://apple.com)
* [Acorns](http://acorns.com)
* [Planned Parenthood](http://plannedparenthood.com)
* [Simple](http://simple.com)
* [Google](http://google.com)
* [Nike](http://nike.com)

<!-- My [resume](/resume) has more specifics if you're interested. -->

My wife Natalie is in an amazing [band](https://thebandjoseph.com/) that you should definitely check out.

I consider it a gift that someone would read my writing so thank you for that. If you have anything to say in response don't hesitate to drop me an [email](mailto:chris@schepman.org).
