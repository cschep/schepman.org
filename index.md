Hello! My name is Chris Schepman and I love helping small businesses solve problems using technology. I'm a generalist at heart, and I pride myself on the ability to contribute value no matter what the technology stack. That said, I have a lot of valuable experience specifically with the Apple ecosystem and also with writing backend web systems in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

I've spent the last 15 years doing things like working on the [News](https://www.apple.com/apple-news/) app at [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/), maximizing developer productivity at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), and building out an app and a private room karaoke system for [Americaâ€™s greatest karaoke night](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/portland-karaoke-scene.html).

I work best with people that are kind and smart. I believe that empathy not only makes for a better work experience, but leads to better systems as well.

Check out my [portfolio](/projects) for a more detailed list of projects and experience. Check out my [blog](/blog) for some of my writing.

<!-- My [resume](/resume) has more specifics if you're interested. -->

If you are looking for help with any sort of technology project please don't hesitate to reach out! I'm currently available for contract based work and [email](mailto:chris@schepman.org) is the best way to reach me.
