Hi! My name is Chris Schepman. I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience that primarily focuses on Apple platforms. I've been writing [Swift](https://swift.org/) since it came out and I've worked on iOS apps that reach millions of users. I have also been known to dabble in [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and even some [DevOps](/2020/07/30/putting-rails-into-production-with-ansible) work!


I work best with people that are kind and smart. I believe that empathy not only makes for a better work experience, but leads to better systems as well.


Check out my [portfolio](/projects) for a more detailed list of projects and experience. Check out my [blog](/blog) for some of my writing.

<!-- My [resume](/resume) has more specifics if you're interested. -->

My wife Natalie is in an amazing [band](https://thebandjoseph.com/) that you should definitely check out.

I consider it a gift that someone would read my writing so thank you for that. If you have anything to say in response don't hesitate to drop me an [email](mailto:chris@schepman.org).
