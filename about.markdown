My name is Chris Schepman. I'm a generalist software engineer with experience shipping across many stacks. I tend to enjoy automation and making boring technology do useful things. I tend to **not** enjoy being disconnected with the results of my work, and having arbitrary rules control the outcome of my work. I work best with people that focus on empathy first. It's a rare trait in our kind, but it is very important to me.

My relevant experience includes working with companies like:

* [Acorns](http://acorns.com)
* [Apple](http://apple.com)
* [Planned Parenthood](http://plannedparenthood.com)
* [Simple](http://simple.com)
* [Google](http://google.com)
* [Nike](http://nike.com)

<!-- My [resume](/resume) has more specifics if you're interested. -->

I consider it a gift that someone would read my writing so thank you for that. If you have anything to say in response I welcome all emails.
