        I was on the team at Apple that shipped News, Stocks, and Weather. Working at Apple involves wrangling enormous amounts of complexity. Tremendous scale, lots of different devices to consider, API's changing out from underneath you, etc. I learned a ton and worked with some incredibly talented developers.

        At Acorns I worked on a handful of things but mainly shipping a new feature called <a href="https://www.acorns.com/early/">Early</a>. This job ended prematurely as they closed the entire Portland office in light of COVID-19.

        Known as the best karaoke experience in the world, Baby Ketten Karaoke recently opened a brick and mortar location. Naturally, they needed some technology to power their private room karaoke experience. We created a very cool web based karaoke player system that BKK brought it's own unique tracks to. Po the whole thing with a cross platform app to parse/host song collections, and a beautiful frontend for users to interact with the system found at <a href="https://bkk.bar">bkk.bar</a>.
